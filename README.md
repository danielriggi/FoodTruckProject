# Description

The Food Truck project allows users to input and rate up to five food trucks. Users can then interact with a menu to view information such as all existing food trucks, the average rating of the trucks, and the highest-rated food truck. The project is structured with a FoodTruck class and a separate class containing the main method.

# Lessons Learned

This project played a crucial role in reinforcing my understanding of object-oriented programming principles. It provided hands-on experience with essential Java methods like get, set, constructor, and toString, deepening my appreciation for their role in building robust and maintainable code. Additionally, delving into the creation and utilization of various classes, complemented by import statements, expanded my ability to structure and organize code effectively.
